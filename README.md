# churn_analysis_prediction

The dataset comprises of customer related information that can be analysed to predict behaviour to retain customers. 

The dataset includes information about:

*Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
*Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
*Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
*Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

A series of estimators were used with implementation of parameter optimisation tools to select the estimator with the highest train, validation and test score to aid in the development of a focused customer retention program.
